        DESCRIPTION      = "A description of the values in this column
is below; the user is first directed to consider the following caveats:

***N.B. This COLUMN is an INTERPRETATION that has been provided at the
        request of the peer reviewers of this data set (Sascha Kempf and
        Mihaly Horanyi, as well as at the request of Michael A'Hearn, the
        director of the PDS Small Bodies Node at the time of delivery of
        this data set), and against the advice of the Stardust-NExT CIDA
        Science Team.

        The gist of the objection of the CIDA team is that a PDS data set
        is an excellent tool for archiving data, not interpretations, and
        that by providing such interpreted data users are encouraged to
        use, and give the same weight to, the interpretations as they would
        raw data.  The proper place for interpretations is in peer-reviewed
        literature, where uncertainties in each interpretation can be
        adequately, and properly, addressed and reviewed.

        The derivation of this ESTIMATE was highly dependent on the quality
        of the data in this spectrum.  It is irresponsible for anyone to
        use these values without significant understanding and experience
        in the interpretration of Time-Of-Flight (TOF) mass spectra.

        Refer to values for keywords DATA_QUALITY_ID and DATA_QUALITY_DESC
        in PDS label for qualitative assessement of this estimate.  The 'a'
        and 'b' estimated values, listed in the DATA_QUALITY_DESC keyword
        string, are an interpretation of these data, and characterize this
        spectrum.

Subject to those caveats, here is the description of this column:

The values in this column are ***APPROXIMATE*** masses, in units of
daltons, for the time-of-flight (TOF) mass lines.  The user is directed
to the caveats above if they want to use these values in any way."

READPDS.PRO DESCRIPTION:                                                                  
=======================                                                                   
                    
READPDS.PRO is an IDL function that reads data from a PDS image or data       
table file and stores it in an IDL structure. (It is the 'top level'          
program that all of the others in this set are written to serve.)             
                                                                              
The calling syntax of READPDS.PRO is as follows:                              
                                                                              
    result = READPDS( filename,[ /SILENT, /NOSCALE] )                         
                                                                              
where:                                                                        
        - 'result' is the data returned from the PDS image or data table      
          file being read by READPDS.                                         
                                                                              
        - 'filename' is a scalar string containing the name of the PDS        
          file to be read.                                                    
                                                                              
        - 'SILENT' is an optional argument to READPDS that will suppress      
          the default display of the size of the array or structure.          
                                                                              
        - 'NOSCALE' is an optional argument to READPDS that will suppress     
          the default application of SCALING_FACTOR and OFFSET values to      
          and PDS IMAGE or QUBE object array.                                 
                                                                              
READPDS.PRO uses all of the functions in this directory:                      
    ADDEOBJ, APPLY_BITMASK, ARRCOLPDS, ARRCOL_STRUCT, ARR_STRUCT, BTABVECT2,  
    CLEANARR, CLEAN, COLL_STRUCT, ELEM_STRUCT, GET_INDEX, HEADPDS, IMAGEPDS,  
    OBJPDS, PDSPAR, POINTPDS, QUBEPDS, READPDS, REMOVE, STR2NUM, TASCPDS,     
    TBINPDS, and TIMEPDS.                                                     
                                                                              
All of these must be present or be in the idl path for READPDS.PRO to         
function properly.                                                            
                                                                              
As of this version, it is intended to be used on MSB and LSB architectures,   
i.e.,'big-endian' and 'little-endian,' respectively.

   Version    Date      Programmer     Description
    4.5    2011-11-11  J. Ritchie    This update corrects how files that contain 
                                     multiple tables and have RECORD_TYPE = STREAM
                                     are handled. Also incorporates functions to 
                                     properly read CONTAINER objects within ASCII
                                     tables. Also minor bug in apply_bitmask.pro 
                                     was fixed where BIT_MASK was trying to be 
                                     applied even if the current object did not
                                     have a bitmask specified.
                               
    4.4    2010-08-10  B. Prager     Improved memory usage in tascpds.pro. Fixed
                                     the selection of INTERCHANGE_FORMAT for
                                     detached labels in tascpds and tbinpds,
                                     as well as record_bytes in tascpds. Fixed a
                                     bug where the .FMT files were not properly
                                     searched for in the directory tree or in
                                     LABEL subfolders.
                                     
    4.3    2011-05-03  E. Teichman   This release incorporates functions to read
                                     BIT_COLUMN, BIT_ELEMENT, and CONTAINER objects.
                                     Fixed to not trim off leading zeroes when
                                     reading keyword values. Modified to handle properly
                                     unsigned integeres in ARRAY objects. Fixed to
                                     reverse bytes if needed when reading binary tables
                                     to handle endianness. Improved pdspar to resolve
                                     pointer references. 

    4.3    2009-01-19  P. Choganwala Enchanced to look into the LABEL directory
                                     for resolving include pointers (references
                                     to structure files). Added function to read
                                     SPREADSHEET. Improved function to read QUBE
                                     objects. Resolved data type range overflow
                                     binary and ASCII tables.
                                     
                                     TABLEPDS was split again into TASCPDS and
                                     TBINPDS. Removed verification of PDS label
                                     included in 4.2 that will be incorporated as
                                     optional in next releases. Incorporated testing
                                     regression routines.
                                     
    4.2.1  2008-02-25  P. Choganwala Resolved BYTE specification problem
                                     in tascpds.pro. The program was not
                                     reading ASCII tables correctly because
                                     of BYTE specification error.The problem
                                     was solved by restucturing if-else statements
                                     in tascpds.pro.
                                                                      
    4.2.1  2007-11-20  P. Choganwala Fixed problem with "=" sign in description 
                                     field. pdspar.pro was not able to distinguish
                                     keywords correctly because it is considering
                                     "=" sign of description fields also.Logic added 
                                     in program so that it can ommit "=" sign
                                     in description and notes.
                                     
    4.2.1  2007-10-14  P. Choganwala Fixed leading zero problem in pdspar.pro
                                     This program was trimming off the leading
                                     zeros while reading keywords.The function
                                     was corrected which was removing leading zeros.
                                     
    4.2    2005-07-15  P. Khetarpal  This release is for IDL v. 6.0 and above. Combined
                                     TASCPDS and TBINPDS into TABLEPDS routine, which
                                     now handles both ascii and binary data processing.
                                     Reorganized the processing line by including
                                     verification of PDS lavel before any other action
                                     is performed. All routines were rewritten to
                                     stabilize the program.
                                     
                                     As of version 4.2 READPDS is intended to be used
                                     on MSB and LSB architectures, i.e. 'big-endian'
                                     and 'little-endian' respectively.

    4.1.1  2005-04-18  P. Khetarpal  Fixed problem with headpds changing the  
                                     name of the input file. Resolved row     
                                     suffix bytes and padding bytes conflict, 
                                     and fixed some minor errors in table     
                                     object reading.                          
                                                                              
    4.1    2004-01-28  P. Khetarpal  Resolved compatibility for both MSB and  
                                     LSB architectures of all routines.       
                                     Array and collection objects routine was 
                                     rewritten for updated standards.         
                                     Re-instated the NOSCALE keyword for      
                                     images and qubes. Included bit masking   
                                     for signed and unsigned integers.        
                                                                              
    4.0    2004-08-01  P. Khetarpal  Rewrote the major routines for reading   
                                     images, tables, and qubes by using IDL   
                                     structures to read data directly, instead
                                     of reading data element by element. Also,
                                     rewrote routines using many levels of    
                                     subroutines, and thorough error-checking.
                                     Heavy comments were added to almost all  
                                     routines. The previous releases of       
                                     version 3.3.x are compiled into one in   
                                     this release of readpds.                 
                                                                              
   3.3.x   2004-03-18  P. Khetarpal  Fixed bugs for reading array objects     
                                     included with other non-array objects for
                                     IDL. Wrote a new binary array routine to 
                                     read arrays with axes greater than 2.

                                     int number of rows or columns; fixed     
                                     item byte issue for reading tables.      
                                                                              
    3.1    2003-10-03  P. Khetarpal  Updated for standards changes; fixed     
                                     minor bugs; increased robustness of      
                                     subroutines; added a subroutine to handle
                                     cleaning of string arrays.               
                                                                              
    3.0    2003-08-05  P. Khetarpal  Updated for standards changes; added

which should return a five dimensional array of data.  Since NAXIS6 = 1,      
IDL ignores this axis (for example, a 128 x 128 x 1 image cube is             
equivalent to a 128 x 128 image).

- the above description is from an example KECK data file in FITS format.     
  The FITS file contains 2 stacked sets (chop-nod sets), each containing      
  2, two-dimensional images. The PDS label was written as an array object     
  to be read and then displayed as an image.

NOTE: Additional programs not written at SBN are required to properly         
access binary table data. They are 'conv_vax_unix.pro' and                    
'ieee_to_host.pro', and may be found in NASA/Goddard's IDL Astronomy Users    
Library (anonymous ftp at idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov /pub/astron.tar.Z or WWW     
URL listed below)                                                             
                                                                              
COMPATIBILITY WARNINGS: These programs have only been tested on IDL           
version 5.3, 6.0, and 7.0.6 for SunOS 8.0 and Centos 5, they may not work as well on other         
systems/versions.                                                             
                                                                              
PDS attached, detached and combined-detached labels as well as include pointers
to structure files (FMT) are supported by these programs.

As of version 4.3, READPDS looks in LABEL subdirectory for files referenced by
include pointers that are not included directly at the location of the PDS file
(both upper and lower case). See Rules for Resolving Pointers in the PDS
Standards document for reference.

A listing of some particularly useful 'idlastro' procedures follow:           
headfits.pro    - retrieves the FITS header from a file                       
readfits.pro    - reads a FITS file, returns data                             
sxaddpar.pro    - add or modify a parameter in a FITS array                   
sxpar.pro       - retrieves specified data from FITS headers                  
wherenan.pro    - finds the position of the IEEE NaN special values
